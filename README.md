# Path-Finding-Visualizer

The pathfinding visualizer is a dynamic tool that allows users to visualize and experiment with various pathfinding algorithms in real-time. By providing a graphical representation of a grid or map, users can set start and end points, place obstacles, and observe how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, or BFS navigate through the maze to find the shortest path. This interactive tool aids in understanding and comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of different pathfinding algorithms.
